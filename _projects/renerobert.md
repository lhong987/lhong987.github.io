## Pictures first

The challenge here was to build a very [simple portfolio website for René Robert](http://www.renerobert.net) that would just let the pictures speak for themselves. I focused on getting the typography right and used a very simple color palette that would blend nicely with René's pictures.

The site is responsive because that's just the way I build websites these days, but it means René can use it to showcase his work to potential clients on his iPad, which he loves.

## Storytelling

We both wanted to avoid the typical way to present picture galleries through thumbnails and modal windows. We looked at various solutions and settled on a very simple one which allow each project to tell a small story using pictures and text captions. This works surprisingly well with his "Great Alpinists" series.

The site is powered by [Craft](buildwithcraft.com) and the Matrix field allows René to add pictures to projects easily, reorder them as he wishes or add quotes in between. He can even preview a project page before publishing it live on his website.
