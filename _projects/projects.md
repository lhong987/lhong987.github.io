## Blink³

Blink³ is a virtual reality puzzle platformer game created by 5 high school students in 24 hours at a local hackathon, hackBCA II. It uses the Oculus Rift headset display for a full 360 degree environment, as well as a hat with 4 CPU fans attached for an added wind effect when moving in game. 

In the 24 hours that we had, we used the programs Unity, Arduino, Autodesk Maya, and Adobe Photoshop to design, code, and 3D model the game.
