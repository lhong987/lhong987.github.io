## A lean and iterative first phase

The [EQUAL](http://equal-partners.eu) project is an interesting one: a group of established and young lawyers stepped out of their comfort zone to create a new company together. They set out to reimagine what a Law Firm could be and found innovative ways to collaborate between themselves and with their clients.

In just 10 days, a team put together by [Major Tom](http://major-tom-company.eu/) worked together to create a brand new logo, a video teaser, a graphical identity and a one page website in three languages. Several photo shootings were conducted as well.

From a web point of view, the priority was to create an online presence for EQUAL. After working on the content, I developed a graphical style guide to establish a design language. A responsive one page website was developed in just 5 days using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

## Phase two: a fully-fledged website

After a memorable inauguration party, it was time to work on the second incarnation of the EQUAL website, powered by [Craft CMS](http://buildwithcraft.com).

The goals were to create a website that would showcase EQUAL's motto: "Law for Better Living". As lawyers, it is crucial for them to be perceived as approachable and in touch with the citizens and their concerns.

The website mainly consists in the following key components, tied together by a simple relationships system:

- A team section with profile pages for each team member
- Detail pages presenting EQUAL's areas of expertise
- Articles written by the team

The website was developed in three languages and, despite its relative complexity, can easily be managed by the EQUAL team, thanks to the ease of use of Craft's control panel.

From the various feedback we had since launch, it looks like we succeeded in creating a website reflecting EQUAL's philosophy and ethos. Its was certainly very interesting to work with a group of people believing in their dreams and setting out to build something new.
