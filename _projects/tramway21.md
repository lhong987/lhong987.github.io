## Objectives

[Tramway21](http://tramway21.be) wanted a relatively simple website presenting the agency and its philosophy. They also wanted to be able to showcase in-depth case studies presenting the work they do for their clients.

The website had to be easy to update by non technical people and the design and content had to reflect the fact that the agency has one foot in the analog advertising and marketing world and the other in the digital space.

## Collaboration with the in-house team

We worked together in a very collaborative way and started with a full day workshop to define the objectives, audiences, contents, data structures and functionalities needed for the website.

After that initial workshop, we agreed on having one weekly meeting together for the duration of the project in order to keep the momentum going.

Collaborating with people having a design sensibility allowed for quick iterations on the design. Photoshoots and content sessions were quickly organised to provide the material needed for the website.

## Branding and web development

The website was also a good opportunity to revisit the branding and the positioning of Tramway21 with the owners, the art director and the project manager.

The CMS development phase was quick, thanks to [Craft CMS](http://buildwithcraft.com). A simple Matrix field allows content publishers to quickly create modular tailor-made pages for each case study using a combination of simple content blocks.

We were all very happy with how the project turned out. Tramway21 is currently working on publishing new case studies and has already integrated the website into its sales and pitching process.
