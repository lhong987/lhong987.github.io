        <p>I work for one client at a time so I can focus all my attention on your project. I favour partnerships over one-shot projects and use a simple iterative workflow.</p>

        <p class="workflow__tagline">Asking a lot of questions</p>
        <p>Getting to know you, your team and your business. I'll be asking a lot of questions and expecting a lot of answers. Discovery helps me define the project scope. Whenever feasible, I will work in your office during this initial phase.</p>

        <h3 class="h4  h4--notop">Guidelines &amp; specifications</h3>
        <p class="workflow__tagline">Defining the scope, thoroughly</p>
        <p>Based on the discovery phase, I draft an information architecture, define the various content types your site needs and their data structure. I also produce wireframes of key pages or screens and a graphical style guide.</p>

        <h3 class="h4  h4--notop">Prototyping &amp; templates</h3>
        <p class="workflow__tagline">Prototyping in actual code</p>
        <p>The next step is to build a prototype using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I like to move to code as soon as possible to materialise responsive layouts, typography and interactivity. It also allows me to iterate quickly towards the final templates.</p>

        <h3 class="h4  h4--notop">Content Management System</h3>
        <p class="workflow__tagline">Structured content and ease of update</p>
        <p>Flexible CMS solutions allow me to build complex functionalities and data structures while your website remains easy to update. I will work closely with the people in charge of content to build a CMS experience that will fit their needs.</p>

        <h3 class="h4  h4--notop">Tests &amp; bug squashing</h3>
        <p class="workflow__tagline">Making sure everything is up to standards</p>
        <p>When the site is ready, you provide me with a minimal amount of content to publish and we test all functionalities together to make sure it is up to standards. Remaining bugs will be squashed properly and diligently.</p>
      </li><!--

        <h3 class="h4  h4--notop">Launch &amp; follow-up</h3>
        <p class="workflow__tagline">Launch day is when it really begins</p>
        <p>After the final payment has been made, the site is published online and the adventure begins. Most clients know I like long term projects and ask me to stay involved for a little while after launch, but that is not mandatory.</p>
