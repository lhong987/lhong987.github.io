    <h2>Ellis Island Virtual Reality Project</h2>
      <h6>Lead Artist</h6>
        <p>Setember 2014 - June 2016</p>
  </header>

  <p>The Ellis Island project is a virtual reality simulation of New York City’s 1920 Ellis Island. In partnership with the National Park Service, our team of high school students modeled and designed a digital 3D version of this historically significant site.</p>
  <p>With the use of the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive for a 360 degree viewpoint, the simulation enables the player to walk through a historical 1920 version of one of Ellis Island’s main buildings: the Registry Room. There, the player is able to meet different immigrants waiting in line and ask them about their family, country, future motives, and more.</p>
  <p>The programs we used include Unity, Autodesk Maya, Adobe Photoshop, Blender, MakeHuman, Quixel, and Arduino. </p>

The game's setting takes place in the midst of the night at a museum, in which a burglar, from a first person VR perspective in the Oculus Rift, attempts to steal treasures and escape. The 2 other players act as security guards and view the museum map from a top-down perspective, hunting down the burglar with flashlights.</p>
